## Tony — original DS4 × H3 Video Gen Factory

**This project is a keyspark fork of Tony’s work. Full credit for the video factory
goes to [tonyd2wild](https://github.com/tonyd2wild).**

| **Upstream repo** | **[tonyd2wild/ds4-h3-video-gen-factory](https://github.com/tonyd2wild/ds4-h3-video-gen-factory)** |
| **Author** | [Tony (tonyd2wild)](https://github.com/tonyd2wild) |

Tony’s factory is the foundation of everything here:

- Dual MiniMax H3 on two DGX Sparks **alongside** full 1M-context DeepSeek-V4-Flash  
- The **DS4-first, then H3** co-tenancy rule (and why reverse order fails)  
- `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.78` profile, `--disable-pinned-memory`, no fake “video mode”  
- Co-tenancy benches: DS4 alone / +1 H3 render / +2 H3 renders (C1–C6)  
- The long-form write-up, banner, and “second render is nearly free” analysis  
- The idea that agents keep answering while video runs

## What this keyspark fork adds (not a replacement)

Extensions **on top of** Tony’s factory, not instead of it:

- Abliterated DSV4F 0731 dual-boot env (`env.ablit-cotenancy`)  
- Heretic TE + enhanced H3 graph (Sage / Sol / Spectrum / FBC / RealESRGAN)  
- Quality-first parallel dual-FLF video path (`deploy/keyspark/`)  
- Agent one-shot recipe + published pre/post speed tables for this lab

**Bottom line:** Tony built the video factory and proved dual H3 + full DS4 co-tenancy.  
This fork is a keyspark dual-boot specialization (ablit + heretic + parallel quality path).  
**Always shout out Tony when you share results from this tree.**
